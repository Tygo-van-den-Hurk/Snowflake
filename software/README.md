## Overview

This module is used to generate the software components. For the firmware we'll be using [QMK](https://qmk.fm). This is because at the time of writing it's recommended to use [ZMK](https://zmk.dev/) for wireless and [QMK](https://qmk.fm) for wired. Since mine is wired I'm gonna be using [QMK](https://qmk.fm). It was also connivent that as of time of writing [QMK](https://qmk.fm) is on [Nix packages](https://search.nixos.org/packages?query=qmk) and [ZMK](https://zmk.dev/) is not.
