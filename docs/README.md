## Overview

In here you can find all the documentation regarding the hardware side of the project. There are a couple entries:

- [Ergogen](./ergogen/README.md): the base we used to build the keyboard.
- [Nix](./nix/README.md): the software that wraps and powers this operation.
- [Build Guide](./build-guide/README.md): how to build the keyboard from nothing.
