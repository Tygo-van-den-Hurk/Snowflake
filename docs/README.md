## Overview

In here you can find all the documentation regarding the hardware side of the project. There are a couple entries:

- [Ergogen](./ergogen/README.md): the base we used to build the keyboard.
- [Nix](./nix/README.md): the software that wraps and powers this operation.

## Components

To build the keyboard you require the following physical components:

| quantity | Name                   | Part number         | Description                                                           |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2        | PCB                    | -                   | The Snowflake PCB order from a fabricator                             |
| 2        | TRRS connector         | TRRS-PJ-320A-dual   | Connector to connect the 2 halves.                                    |
| 2        | Reset button           | wuerth-434121025816 | Any button of the right size will work.                               |
| 2        | 0805 SMD Resistor 4.7k | -                   | Any resistor between 2.2k and 10k will work, with 4.7k being optimal. |
| 2        | 0805 SMD Resistor 10k  | -                   | Any resistor between 2.2k and 10k will work, with 10k being optimal.  |
| 36       | choc switches          | -                   | Any choc switch will work, pick your favorite.                        |
| 36       | choc key caps          | -                   | Any choc key cap will work, pick your favorite.                       |

You will also need solder equipement and supplies like solder. This is entire up to you.
