## Overview

Nix is the wrapper that extends the ergogen output. It is the glue between all these separate projects and dependencies. Using Nix will ensure that you are able to produce the same output as I am.

## Getting started

To get started install `nix` using [the official website nix](https://nixos.org/download) for instructions on how to download. After that, make sure to enable flakes and nix command if they are not stable yet by the time you read this.

run `nix flake check` in the repository to ensure that everything works the way it is supposed to.
